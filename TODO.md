# To Do list for Cldr Units

* Not all units are translatable in all locales - so what is the canonical list of units?
* How do we localise units that have no translation in a given locale?
* How do we get the measurement systems of units that have no conversion (since thats where the system data is kept)
* What is the intention of the new unit systems?

[ ] Support any unit in `Cldr.Unit.display_name/1`
[ ] Fix use of generic unit `:unit`
[ ] Math using scalars for mult and sub should work
[ ] Math with powers should work
[ ] Support `pown` notation for powers beyond square and cubic
